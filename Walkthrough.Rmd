## Intro

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

We're using <https://rstudio.cloud/> to host the workshop. The conditions of use mean we can only use this for educational purposes. It's a great resource for teaching, but is underpowered for most analysis. The big advantage is you can access RStudio through a web browser without the need to install anything!

The dataset you'll be working with today is the developer survey from Stackoverflow.
You can download it from <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey>.

## Packages

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Language tips

* functions end in ()
* `?` before a function name for help
* objects are plain text
* %>% sends output to next function
* Wrap strings in "" or ''
* Separate arguments in function with a `,`
* Use formatting to make code easier to read


## Data

### Read

```{r data}
df = read_csv("~/Downloads/developer_survey_2019/survey_results_public.csv")
schema = read_csv("~/Downloads/developer_survey_2019/survey_results_schema.csv")

?read_csv
```


### Explore

* See the `Environment` pane.
* What did R return after each dataset was read?

```{r explore}
schema
glimpse(df)
summary(df)
View(df)
colnames(df)
```


## Building blocks


### Select columns

```{r select}
df %>% 
   select(Employment, Country)

df %>% 
   select(-Respondent)
```


### Filter rows

```{r filter}
df %>% 
   filter(Employment == "Not employed, but looking for work")

df %>% 
   filter(Employment != "Not employed, but looking for work")
```


### Count observations

```{r count}
df %>% 
   count(Employment)

df %>% 
   count(Employment, Country)

df %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   count(Employment, Country)
```


### Sort data

```{r sort}
df %>% 
   count(Employment) %>% 
   arrange(desc(n))
```


### Add/change variables

```{r mutate}
df %>% 
   select(WorkWeekHrs) %>% 
   mutate(work_week = WorkWeekHrs / (24 * 7))
```


### Summarise

Similar to mutate, but collapses results

```{r summarise}
df %>% 
   group_by(Country) %>% 
   summarise(hrs = mean(WorkWeekHrs))

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country, WorkWeekHrs) %>% 
   group_by(Country) %>% 
   summarise(hrs = mean(WorkWeekHrs))

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country, WorkWeekHrs) %>% 
   group_by(Country) %>% 
   summarise(hrs = mean(WorkWeekHrs)) %>% 
   arrange(desc(hrs))

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country, WorkWeekHrs) %>% 
   group_by(Country) %>% 
   summarise(hrs = mean(WorkWeekHrs),
             n = n()) %>% 
   arrange(desc(hrs))

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country, WorkWeekHrs) %>% 
   group_by(Country) %>% 
   summarise(hrs = mean(WorkWeekHrs),
             n = n()) %>% 
   arrange(desc(hrs)) %>% 
   filter(n > 100)
```

Could do that fancy Bayes trick here...

## Plotting

Reiterate the tidyverse pages: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/>

```{r ggplot}
ggplot(df, aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar()

df %>% 
   mutate(Country = fct_lump(Country, 20)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar()

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country) %>% 
   mutate(Country = fct_lump(Country, 20)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar() +
   coord_flip()

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country) %>% 
   mutate(Country = fct_lump(Country, 20)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(title = "Survey respondents",
        x = "",
        y = "Respondents")

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country) %>% 
   mutate(Country = fct_lump(Country, 20),
          Country = fct_infreq(Country)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(title = "Survey respondents",
        x = "",
        y = "Respondents")

df %>% 
   drop_na(Country) %>% 
   mutate(Country = fct_lump(Country, 20),
          Country = fct_infreq(Country)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(Country)) +
   geom_bar() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(title = "Survey respondents country",
        x = "",
        y = "Respondents") +
   theme_light()
```


## Functions

```{r function}
plot_function = function(i){
   df %>% 
      rename_(temp = i) %>% 
      drop_na(temp) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(temp)) +
      geom_bar() +
      coord_flip() +
      labs(title = schema %>% 
           filter(Column == i) %>% 
           select(QuestionText) %>% 
           str_wrap(width = 60) ,
           x = "",
           y = "Respondents") +
      theme_light()
}

plot_function("WorkLoc")
```


## Question

Here we can put it all together, with a little more magic to establish a question.

```{r question, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
df %>% 
   filter(str_detect(LanguageWorkedWith, ";R;")) %>% 
   mutate(EdLevel = replace_na(EdLevel, "Unanswered"),
          EdLevel = str_wrap(EdLevel, width=60),
          EdLevel = fct_infreq(EdLevel)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(EdLevel)) +
   geom_bar() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(title = schema %>% 
           filter(Column == "EdLevel") %>% 
           select(QuestionText) %>% 
           str_wrap(width = 60),
        subtitle = "For respondents who work with R",
        x = "",
        y = "Respondents") +
   facet_wrap(~str_wrap(MainBranch, width=40))
```

* Popular with hobby students
* Popular with researchers - probably!

**Q:** Can you explore the last statement?
